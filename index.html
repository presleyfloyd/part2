        <h1>Intro</h1>

        <p>This is Frankie. My mom flew to Virginia in July of 2019 to get him and his brother Tito with her best friend. He is incredibly friendly, he loves to play, and he will do anything for a treat. When we got him, he was meant to be the family dog, but he quickly became my sister's baby. He goes everywhere with her, and sadly, when she moves out, he might have to go with her. He loves hikes, the beach, and warmth, but mostly he loves my sister Maddy.</p>
